abstract: "This project aims to transform 4,337 humanitarian incident reports into a tactical intelligence brief for operational decision-makers. By analyzing attacks on aid workers from 1997 to 2025 across 75+ countries, it reveals systemic risk disparities, behavioral threat patterns, and predictive signals for future violence. The analysis culminates in a prototype that demonstrates how structured data and machine learning can power real-time risk scoring, early alerts, and strategic field deployment."

Across some of the world's most fragile regions, humanitarian aid workers — from 1997 to the present — have faced an escalating spectrum of violent threats, ranging from ambushes to abductions. This project transforms raw incident records into a threat - informed intelligence layer to support operational decision - making.

By analyzing thousands of recorded attacks on UN agencies, international NGOs, and Red Cross affiliates, I uncovered patterns in **time**, **geography**, and **modus operandi**. This allows us to identify not only where humanitarian work is most dangerous, but also trace how threat environments shift over time.

The approach is inspired by **real-time situational awareness** platforms commonly used in defense and security contexts @kurpiewska2024digital. Just as Palantir empowers decision - makers in conflict zones, this project aims to do the same for humanitarian stakeholders — equipping them with **foresight, not just hindsight** @martin2023aidwashing.
