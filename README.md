This project aims to transform 4,337 humanitarian incident reports into a tactical intelligence brief for operational decision-makers. By analyzing attacks on aid workers from 1997 to 2025 across 75+ countries, it reveals systemic risk disparities, behavioral threat patterns, and predictive signals for future violence. The analysis culminates in a prototype that demonstrates how structured data and machine learning can power real-time risk scoring, early alerts, and strategic field deployment.
