The dataset contains **4,337 recorded incidents**, each representing a confirmed attack against humanitarian operations between **1997 and 2025**. Structured at the **event level**, these records document **operational disruptions** — not individuals or fixed locations. As such, the data is best understood as a **chronicle of threat encounters**, not a risk likelihood model.

Certain fields — such as victim counts and agency involvement — offer strong fidelity, thanks to uniforms and ICRC - compliant markings. These details enable reliable quantification of **affected nationals vs. internationals** and **targeted organizations** such as the **UN**, **INGOs**, and **Red Cross affiliates**.

However, critical intelligence gaps persist. Variables like *actor name*, *motive*, and *means of attack* are frequently marked as "Unknown." This reflects a practical reality: in high - risk environments, **immediate triage and rescue take precedence over detailed record-keeping**, often resulting in delayed or degraded data collection.

From an analytical standpoint, these incidents should ideally be contextualized against **baseline rates** — such as the number of deployed personnel, mission types, or vehicle movements in each region. While unavailable in this dataset, such baseline indicators remain a critical frontier for future humanitarian intelligence systems.
